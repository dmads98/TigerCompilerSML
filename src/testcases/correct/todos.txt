-  non-existant labels used for jump targets(ex. test27) -3
- functions/program does not exit, just jumps to label with nothing -3

- malloc needs number of bytes to be allocated, not number of words -1
- seems that main is omited in some instances, causing the program entry to be in the middle of a process call w/o argumens meaning that references to arguments are random previously non-existant temps (ex. test4) -10
- Non-existant labels used as targets for jumps (ex. test4) -3
- results of function returned through $v0, but not read from $v0 -2
- no nil checks for records -2
- late (if you were granted an extension please let me know) -20

- array size stored at 0 instead of -4
- strings formated incorrectly -3
